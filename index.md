# Projects 

## [Crypto](https://github.com/cybereagle2001/Crypto) 

this script is created by cybereagle2001, oussama ben hadj dahman, developped by cybereagle2001 and Oussema Aloui.
I thought that it so important to secure some documents it will allow people to conserve their own privacy so I created the first version of Crypto based on some kali linux tools. -It's so easy to use. All what you need is to write or past your text after choosing the encryption or decryption option and Crypto will create a new file where you will found your document encrypted or decrypted.
Crypto V0.2 is written in python 2.7. We developped Crypto so that it can run on GNU/LINUX ,WINDOWS and MAC OS.
-Crypto V0.3 is written in python 3. We worked on better performance and higher encryption algorithms. We will update the project and we will add new encryption algorithms soon.

## [CandyMath](https://github.com/cybereagle2001/CandyMath)

As a Math and computer Science student at the faculty of science of Tunis. I created a Program that will summarize and use all what we learned through the semester using python language.
CandyMath was a simple idea that can combine Mathematics and computer science. I used different modules like maths algorithms, file manipulation and graphs drawing in this Project. What pushed me more to create this program is it's ability to be developed into machine learning and have better chances to solve different maths equations. Not only pre-programmed ones.
